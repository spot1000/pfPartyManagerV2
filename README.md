# pfPartyManagerV2

This is a second attempt at the partymanger/character creation sheet for Pathfinder (V1 currently) This second repo will be used to determine is TypeScript will make my life easier or not. 

Repos will be updated accordingly

## Current Goals
  - Simple login that will be used to track peoples parties/character
  - Make a character sheet that will accept inputs for all values, and does required math for calculated fields
  - Hook into DB for repository
  - Make a table that will track certain stats (preferably being able to choose which stats are shown

## Future Goals
  - Hook character creation into stats DB to pre-fill all class/race/equipment bomuses
  - Hook into Feats DB to auto-fill all stat updates
  - Leveling log for players
  - Feat Tree for planning
  - Printable PDF for character sheet
  - Homebrew stats/races/feats/classes which are updated by the GM, and only shown when character is attached to that party
  - More to come as I think of them
  
## Completed Goals
  - None (I've just started this repo, checkback for updates)
  
More updates to come as I flesh out the app
